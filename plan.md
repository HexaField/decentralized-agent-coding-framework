# Decentralized AI-Enhanced Development System Specification

This document serves as a **system specification** for a decentralized, AI-augmented development environment designed to enable secure, collaborative, and agent-augmented coding workflows across multiple machines and organizations. It defines the goals, requirements, and operational behavior rather than just the architecture.

---

## 1. Goals

1. **Unified Orchestrator Image:**

   * Provide a single Docker image that runs as the main software on a user’s machine.
   * Allow connections to other nodes on the same Tailscale network.

2. **Distributed Kubernetes Clusters (Talos-managed):**

   * Each 'organization' has a dedicated distributed Kubernetes cluster managed by Talos.
   * Users belonging to multiple organizations may have multiple clusters running on the same machine.
   * Clusters support agent deployment, resource sharing, and workload scheduling.

3. **User and Agent Identity Separation:**

   * Users log into the main orchestrator image with their credentials for Git, Radicle, Obsidian, and other services.
   * Agents run the same Docker image in Kubernetes with **distinct credentials**, identifying them as agent nodes separate from users.

4. **Agent Functionality:**

   * Agents run as Kubernetes pods anywhere on the Tailscale network, scheduled based on available resources via the orchestrator load-balancer.
   * Each agent includes a VS Code server for remote user access.
   * Agents execute **agentic workflows** (OpenAI Codex, Copilot, etc.) via CLI commands invoked by Spec-Kit running in the user’s main image.
   * Agents build **local context for tasks**, complete work (coding, testing, documentation), and submit PRs for review by humans or other bot agents.

5. **Task and Workflow Management:**

   * Spec-Kit serves as the task and requirement tracking system.
   * User orchestrator nodes invoke Spec-Kit in agent images to initialize context and track task execution.
   * PRs, task progress, logs, and context are shared across the network and visible in the user’s web interface.

6. **Unified Monitoring and Control Interface:**

   * Users have a **web-based dashboard** that shows:

     * Users, agents, devices, resources, tasks, and clusters.
     * PRs and review status.
     * Agent workflow execution and logs.
   * The dashboard includes an AI interface for invoking commands, scheduling tasks, and interacting with the system programmatically.

7. **Secure, Global Connectivity:**

   * All orchestrator and agent nodes communicate over **Tailscale VPN**, ensuring secure, encrypted mesh networking.
   * Resource access, credential separation, and ACLs are enforced across all nodes and clusters.

8. **Human-in-the-Loop Collaboration:**

   * Users maintain ultimate control and review authority over PRs and tasks.
   * Agents augment human workflows but are auditable, traceable, and sandboxed.

## 2. System Breakdown

### Part 1: Kubernetes / Tailscale Resource-Sharing VPN + AI-Enhanced Dashboard

**Purpose:** Provide a secure, global resource mesh and a unified control surface.

**Core elements**

* **Local Orchestrator (single image):** Runs on each machine, peers with other orchestrators via Tailscale managed by Headscale, exposes gRPC/HTTP for scheduling, health, and metrics.
* **Tailscale Mesh (Headscale-controlled):** Encrypted overlay that connects orchestrators, cluster nodes, and services without public exposure; ACLs managed by Headscale control server define who can talk to whom.
* **Distributed Kubernetes per Organization:** Each org has its own logical/physical cluster managed by Talos; multiple org clusters may co-reside on a host.
* **Scheduling & Placement:** Orchestrators coordinate capacity announcements (CPU/GPU/mem/tags), negotiate placement across peers, and enforce policies/quotas.
* **AI-Enhanced Dashboard:** Web UI that aggregates state from orchestrators and clusters (users, agents, nodes, tasks, PRs, health); includes an AI command bar for natural-language control.

**Interfaces & APIs**

* `GET /health`, `GET /capacity`, `POST /schedule`, `POST /evict`, `GET /pods` on each orchestrator.
* Dashboard queries orchestrators (read-only) and issues write ops with RBAC + mTLS.

**Security**

* Tailscale device identity + node tags via Headscale; mTLS between orchestrators; signed workload manifests; K8s RBAC/NetworkPolicies.

### Part 2: Agent Workflow (Spec-Kit, code-server, Radicle, Obsidian)

**Purpose:** Execute tasks autonomously (or semi-autonomously) with full context and human-in-the-loop review.

**Lifecycle**

1. **Task Origination:** User (or bot) creates/updates a task in **Spec-Kit** from the main orchestrator.
2. **Dispatch:** Orchestrator selects a target org cluster/node and schedules an **Agent Pod** (same base image, agent credentials).
3. **Context Build:** Agent initializes local working dir, mounts or syncs repo, pulls **MCP** context; optionally syncs relevant **Obsidian** notes.
4. **Execution:** Agent runs **code-server** for human access; invokes CLI tools (e.g., Copilot/Codex linters/test runners) to implement the task.
5. **Collaboration:** Agent pushes a branch and opens a PR via **Radicle**; reviewer bots and humans comment and request changes.
6. **Reporting:** Agent posts status/artifacts back to **Spec-Kit**; MCP indexes logs, diffs, and decisions for future retrieval.

**Roles & Identity**

* **User Orchestrator Identity:** Holds user’s Git/Radicle/Obsidian credentials locally.
* **Agent Identity:** Distinct credentials (scoped tokens), used only inside agent pods; least-privilege with time-bound validity.

**Observability**

* Streaming logs from agent pods to dashboard; PR links; task state machine visible in Spec-Kit and in the dashboard.

---

### Part 3: Other Potential Workloads in the Cluster

**Purpose:** Extend the platform beyond coding agents to organization-specific services.

**Examples**

* **CI/CD Runners:** Ephemeral runners that spin up per-PR to run tests/builds using cluster resources.
* **Data/ML Jobs:** Notebook servers, fine-tuning jobs, vector indexing, batch inference, or evaluation pipelines.
* **DocOps:** Static site generators (MkDocs/Docusaurus) tied to the Obsidian vault and PR events.
* **Security Tooling:** SAST/DAST scanners, SBOM generators, license compliance checks that run as jobs on PR events.
* **Observability Stack:** Loki/Tempo/Prometheus/Grafana (read-only dashboards exposed through the platform UI).
* **Caches & Artifacts:** Registry mirrors (Harbor), package caches, and ephemeral artifact stores attached to tasks.

**Policies**

* Each workload class has admission controls, quotas, and network policies; placement governed by tags (e.g., `gpu:true`, `region:ap-southeast-2`, `compliance:restricted`).

* **Docker:** Runs the main orchestrator and agent images to provide a consistent containerized environment.
* **Kubernetes (Talos-managed clusters):** Orchestrates agent pods, workloads, and ephemeral resources across the network.
* **Tailscale VPN (Headscale):** Provides encrypted mesh networking for orchestrators and agents across machines, with Headscale as the control server.
* **AI-Enhanced Dashboard (Web UI):** Unified control plane to view and act on users, agents, clusters, tasks, PRs.
* **VS Code Server (code-server):** Allows users to access and edit files on agent nodes through a browser.
* **OpenAI Codex / Copilot CLI:** Enables agentic workflows for automated coding tasks.
* **Spec-Kit:** Tracks tasks, requirements, and workflow state across orchestrator and agent nodes.
* **Radicle:** Handles decentralized version control and PR workflows.
* **Obsidian:** Stores notes, documentation, and context for MCP indexing.
* **Memory & Context Plane (MCP):** Aggregates semantic context, logs, and PR metadata for AI agents.
* **PostgreSQL / Vector Database:** Stores MCP context, embeddings, and metadata for agent queries.
* **API Layer (FastAPI/Flask/gRPC):** Provides communication endpoints for orchestrator, agents, MCP, and Spec-Kit.
